## Hi there 👋

- 📛 I'm Berkin _[bear-kin]_ Anık from Ankara, Turkey 🇹🇷 and I live in Berlin, Germany 🇩🇪.

- 🎓 I'm a B.Sc. in Electrical-Electronics Engineering from [METU](https://metu.edu.tr/). I initially started studying Medicine at Hacettepe University but I left after 2 years to become an Engineer which I thought would suit me better.

- 🧑‍💼 I'm working at [@DeliveryHero](https://github.com/deliveryhero) as a Software Engineer. From August 2022 to December 2023, I was working remotely in Turkey and, since January 2024 I work on-site in Berlin.

- ⚙️ I've graduated in summer of 2023 from METU, but I've been working as a software developer full-time since August 2021. Lockdowns of COVID-19 pandemic and realising switching to a CS program like Computer Engineering would have been better, I've spent most of my free, but not so free time on studying software development while studying my bachelors courses. From August 2021 to August 2022, I worked as a full-time intern at [@DogusTeknoloji](https://github.com/DogusTeknoloji). While studying for my courses at school and working 8-5, 5 days a week as a Software Developer, I also had chance to start my own startup by getting invitations from couple of incubation programs between November 2020 to October 2022. But it unfortunately left unfinished while we're working on the MVP development stage.

- 🌱 I actually started all this programming / web development with a Python course I took from Udemy in late 2019. I also did little bit of SQL and some basic HTML/CSS and JS. After those, I had the opportunity to apply everything I learnt online during the beginning of pandemic. I accepted a freelance job and developed an in-house people-hour tracking application, which is happily in production since July 2020. [That app](https://portal.yapifen.com.tr) was a monolith python (flask) application with MySQL database, used vanilla JS, bootstrap, jinja templates, and is running on a CentOS VPS. I've even implemented some alerting logic using automated mailing to myself for error monitoring and did some logging to a text file on the filesystem. Looking back to code I wrote back then, of course that looks quite bad 😅 and I feel sorry my junior self who didn't have any idea about web frameworks, design principles, ci/cd automation, monitoring tools or cloud solutions etc., but I'm glad I did that! 

- 💾 METU EE offers various specialization areas for senior students including the [Computer Area](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/computer-area). I've taken many computer area courses offered by our department. Those included courses like Data Structures, Networking, Operating Systems, Microprocessors, Computer Architecture, etc. Many courses we took as EE students were utilizing C / C++ development, and in computer design courses we have used many things like Verilog, VHDL and Assembly. I've made some FPGA design and development for my bachelor studies using VHDL, Verilog and also implemented some solutions for networking or did some operating system homeworks using Python, C++ etc. For my Capstone project, in a team of 5, I've developed a GUI for our table tennis robot using TypeScript, React & Vite. I also implemented some parts of the controller and motor drivers which were written in python and were running on a Raspberry Pi. Before starting my internship at DogusTeknoloji, I've attended a Summer Internship at TUBITAK SAGE in Degital Design Department where I did some FPGA development using VHDL in summer of 2021.

- 👨‍💻 As a Software Engineer, I specialize in full-stack web development. My primary focus and work experience are on the TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem, where I leverage frameworks like React alongside tools such as Next.js, Remix, and custom SSR implementations with Express. Additionally, I proficiently develop backend services using Node.js, Deno, Python, or Go, with expertise in containerization using Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, and management of both SQL and NoSQL databases.

- 🛠️ Beyond React, I explore VanillaJS and WebAPIs to deepen my understanding of core technologies, ensuring adaptability to diverse project requirements and staying abreast of emerging trends in UI development and other frameworks like Solid, Vue etc.

- 📊 With a strong foundation in software engineering principles, I excel in architecting end-to-end systems, meticulously considering every facet of a software product's lifecycle. Drawing from entrepreneurial experience, including founding (and failing) a startup and navigating incubation programs, I bring a strategic business perspective to my work, aligning technical solutions with organizational goals.
