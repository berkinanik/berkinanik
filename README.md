## Hi there 👋

- 📛 I'm Berkin Anık from Ankara, Turkey 🇹🇷 and I live in Berlin, Germany 🇩🇪.

- 🎓 I'm a B.Sc. in Electrical-Electronics Engineering from [METU](https://metu.edu.tr/). I initially started studying Medicine at Hacettepe University but I left after 2 years to become an Engineer which I thought would suit me better.

- 🧑‍💼 I'm working at [@DeliveryHero](https://github.com/deliveryhero) as a Software Engineer. From August 2022 to December 2023, I was working remotely in Turkey and, since January 2024 I work on-site in Berlin.

- ⚙️ I've graduated in summer of 2023 from METU, but I've been working as a software developer full-time since August 2021. Lockdowns of COVID-19 pandemic and realising switching to a CS program like Computer Engineering would have been better, I've spent most of my free, but not so free time on studying software development while studying my bachelors courses. From August 2021 to August 2022, I worked as a full-time intern at [@DogusTeknoloji](https://github.com/DogusTeknoloji). While studying for my courses at school and working 8-5, 5 days a week as a Software Developer, I also had chance to start my own startup by getting invitations from couple of incubation programs between November 2020 to October 2022. But it unfortunately left unfinished while we're working on the MVP development stage.

- 👨‍💻 As a Software Engineer, I specialize in full-stack web development. My primary focus and work experience are on the TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem, where I leverage frameworks like React alongside tools such as Next.js, Remix, and custom SSR implementations with Express. Additionally, I proficiently develop backend services using Node.js, Deno, Python, or Go, with expertise in containerization using Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, and management of both SQL and NoSQL databases.

- 🛠️ Beyond React, I explore VanillaJS and WebAPIs to deepen my understanding of core technologies, ensuring adaptability to diverse project requirements and staying abreast of emerging trends in UI development and other frameworks like Solid, Vue etc.

- 📊 With a strong foundation in software engineering principles, I excel in architecting end-to-end systems, meticulously considering every facet of a software product's lifecycle. Drawing from entrepreneurial experience, including founding (and failing) a startup and navigating incubation programs, I bring a strategic business perspective to my work, aligning technical solutions with organizational goals.
