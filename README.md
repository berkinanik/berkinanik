## Hi there 👋

- 📛 I'm Berkin Anık from 🇹🇷.

- 🏫 I'm a B.Sc. in Electrical-Electronics Engineering from [METU](https://metu.edu.tr/).

- 🧑‍💼 I'm working at [@DeliveryHero](https://github.com/deliveryhero) as a Software Engineer.

- 👨‍💻 As a Software Engineer, I specialize in full-stack web development. My primary focus and work experience are on the TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem, where I leverage frameworks like React alongside tools such as Next.js, Remix, and custom SSR implementations with Express. Additionally, I proficiently develop backend services using Node.js, Deno, Python, or Go, with expertise in containerization using Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, and management of both SQL and NoSQL databases.

- 🛠️ Beyond React, I explore VanillaJS and WebAPIs to deepen my understanding of core technologies, ensuring adaptability to diverse project requirements and staying abreast of emerging trends in UI development and other frameworks like Solid, Vue etc.

- 📊 With a strong foundation in software engineering principles, I excel in architecting end-to-end systems, meticulously considering every facet of a software product's lifecycle. Drawing from entrepreneurial experience, including founding (and failing) a startup and navigating incubation programs, I bring a strategic business perspective to my work, aligning technical solutions with organizational goals.
